# udev_rules

these are the udev rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/ for my laptop(s).

It has the ICOM transceiver's serialnumbers in to be able to generate 
the right and most handy /dev/ devices. This means that you can use them
but adjust the serial numbers accordingly.

Same holds for the adalm pluto.

The persistent net rules -- depends on your used hardware. You can use it but 
it would/could affect your network. 

So down the line: the serial rules for the usb devices pluto and icom are of interest to you.
